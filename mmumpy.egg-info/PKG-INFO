# bumpy

You can pip install it by doing:

```sh
pip install bumpy
```

This package is me reimplementing some of numpy's matrix manipulations.

My implementations are not made to be efficient. I made this python package because I initially already made some of these functions for fun and I thought I'd make a package to put it all together into something. It is also for me to learn how to make python packages.

Some of the things I did include:

* Created my own type of error called `MatrixError`
