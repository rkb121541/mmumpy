# mmumpy

You can pip install it by doing:

```sh
pip install mmumpy
```

This package includes my implementations of some of numpy's matrix manipulations.

My implementations are not made to be efficient. I made this python package because I initially already made some of these functions for fun and I thought I'd make a package to put it all together into something. It is also for me to learn how to make python packages and upload them.
